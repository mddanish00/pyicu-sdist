# pyicu-sdist

This repository is just mirror of Source Distribution of PyICU that posted on official PyPI. This repo intended to supplement [pyicu-build](https://github.com/cgohlke/pyicu-build) when consumed though my [python-index](https://github.com/mddanish00/python-index).

New sdist will be added automatically every time new Release added on pyicu-build.
